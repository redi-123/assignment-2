<h1>History of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not 
  a new technology for researchers. This technology is much older 
than you would imagine. Even there are the myths of Mechanical 
 men in Ancient Greek and Egyptian Myths. The following informations in the table are
some milestones in the 
history of AI which define the journey from 
the AI generation to till date development</h2><br>
<h2>
<table border="5px">
    <tr>
    <td>1956</td>
    <td>The term “artificial intelligence” is coined by John McCharty at a <br>
        Dartmouth conference and AI is founded as an academic discipline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>1956–1974</td>
    <td>The golden years of AI enjoy government funding in promising, <br>
    logic-based problem-solving approaches.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1974–1980</td>
        <td>Overly high expectations coupled with the limited capacities
             of AI programs leads to the first “AI winter”, with reduced funding<br> 
             and interest in AI research.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1980–1987</td>
        <td>The rise of knowledge-based expert systems brings new 
            successes and a change in the focus of research and funding
             toward this form of AI.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1987–1993</td>
        <td>The second “AI winter” starts with the sudden collapse of the specialized
            hardware industry in 1987. The AI hype brings with it negative perceptions
            by governments and investors, as expert systems show their limitations and 
            prove expensive to update and maintain. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1993–2011</td>
        <td>Optimism about AI returns and increases. 
            New successes are marked with the help of increased computational power and
             AI becomes data-driven. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2012–today</td>
        <td>Increased availability of data, connectedness and computational power 
            allow for breakthroughs in machine learning, mainly in neural networks and 
            deep learning, heralding a new era of increased funding and optimism about
            the AI potential.
